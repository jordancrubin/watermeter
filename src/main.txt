/*
  Change this to main.cpp to compile test programme in platform.io
  main.cpp - Test programme for reed switch pulse actuated water meters 
  This one designed around the DAE Water Meter Model V-100P
  Most of these meters operate in the same manner, the difference
  can be adjusted as parameters in the instance creation.

  //WATERMETER::WATERMETER(int signalGPIOpin, bool useInternalPullups,char measure, long dbounce ,bool useFS, float incr, int saveInterval, bool debug)
   Using GPIO 15                             [15]
   Using internal pullup resistors           [true]
   This meter is designed as gallons         [g]
   Debounce delay in ms                      [100] 
   Use SD card to autosave meter to filesys  [true]          
   The value of measurment added each time   [.1] i.e. .1 gallons per pulse
   The save interval to FS in seconds        [30] 0 disables autosave 
   Toggle some debug to console              [true] 

  When saving to the filesystem, one type of filesystem must be uncommented in Watermeter.cpp USE_SPIFFS or USE_SD.
  You MUST choose one, and ONLY one. Software arrives defaulted to USE_SPIFFS.

  If SD card is set to true the programme will expect a fat32 formatted SD card installed in the unit.
  It uses the default connections.  SPIFFS hase been completely removed as of this version, given the
  constant barrage of read and saves to the ESP32 thousands of times over is unhealthy for the device.
  The save interval further limits constant writes to the SD card by limiting updates to the interval. 

  CS	  -> GPIO 5
  MOSI	-> GPIO 23
  CLK	  -> GPIO 18
  MISO	-> GPIO 19

  The codes are:
  OK -    Everything worked as expected
  ERR-    The SPIFFS system was corrupted and couldnt be mounted
  NEW-    It found no Metre file and created a new one
  RESET-  The file had data errors and was re-initialized
  NONE-   The function was executed but the object has no param for SPIFFS support

 This allows the setting of the meter in the object to a specified value
 That might match tat of an analogue gauge on the metre
